Findpaw_NFC is a remarkable open-source NFC management application designed with the well-being of your beloved pets in mind. Its primary mission is to empower pet owners by allowing them to encode their personal contact information onto an NFC tag of their choice. In the unfortunate event that your cherished pet goes astray and is found by a kind-hearted soul, the process of reuniting with your furry friend becomes incredibly swift and hassle-free.

With Findpaw_NFC, there's no need to rely on social media searches or lost pet posters. Instead, the solution is as simple as scanning the NFC tag attached to your pet. This scan instantly provides the finder with your contact details, ensuring a prompt and worry-free reunion.

To show your support for this noble cause, you can consider opting for one of our personalized pet tags specially crafted for this purpose. However, we respect your freedom to use any NFC tag of your choice with our application. If you have any questions or wish to reach out, feel free to contact us at kristiformilchev@outlook.com. Join us in making a difference and safeguarding the well-being of your furry family members.
